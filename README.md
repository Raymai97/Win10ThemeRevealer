# Win10ThemeReviver
Revive the hidden themes in Windows 10!

This program is inspired by this article:
http://winaero.com/blog/get-colored-title-bars-in-windows-10/

Win10 Theme Reviver allows you to get the Colored Title Bar with least effort and least modification to your system.
You can also try out the hidden Windows Lite theme which is actually using the visual style used by Ease of Access themes.

It is developed and tested on Windows 10 Enterprise x64 Build 10240 (Japanese), but it should works on recent Win10 builds too.
